Anna Pavlovna's reception was in full swing.
With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this
brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups.
One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Helene, Prince 
Vasili's daughter, and the little Princess Bolkonskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.
The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna.
The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity 
but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself.
