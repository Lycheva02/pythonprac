6
Now the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
«Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fatherś houses, according to the number of names, every male individually,
from twenty years old and above--all who are able to go to war in Israel. You and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
And with you there shall be a man from every tribe, each one the head of his fatheŕs house.
«These are the names of the men who shall stand with you: from Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;
from Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
from Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
from Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar;
from Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;
from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
from Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni;
from Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;
from Asher, Pagiel the son of Ocran;
from Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel;
from Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.»
These were chosen from the congregation, leaders of their fatherś tribes, heads of the divisions in Israel.
